# Weaving Aguayos: *A data visualization project*

ðŸŒŽ Live Project: [https://aguayos.netlify.app](https://aguayos.netlify.app)

## Overview

Latin American and Caribbean countries have a long history of welcoming migrants from neighboring territories. Using data from the United Nations on migration, I created mirrored bar charts to illustrate the magnitude of migrants welcomed by each country in the region. These visualizations, inspired by traditional Andean weavings known as aguayos, aim to reflect the cultural interweaving that migration fosters.
